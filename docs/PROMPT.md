Help me create a Product Requirment Document. Here's what we're building:

A Indonesian PPOB (Payment Point Online Bank) web-based platform.

The tech stack I know I will use, NodeJS with hono for API see @apps\api and Vue.js for Web see @apps\web

These are the feature I want to include:
- Utility bill payments (PLN, PDAM, PGN)
- Telecom products (Pulsa, data packages, post-paid)
- Financial services (BPJS, multi-finance, credit cards)
- Digital vouchers (Games, streaming, e-wallets)
- Tax and education payments
- Profit margin and commission management
- Multi-level marketing/referral system
- Real-time transaction processing
- Inquiry feature for bill validation
- Balance deposit system (Bank, VA, QRIS)
- Transaction history and financial reporting
- 2FA/PIN security and device binding
- Fraud detection monitoring

I will be building this with an AI co-pilot, so I don't need any team milestones or anything like that. Do not write any code yourself.
Write only on markdown format (.md) and save in @docs/PRD.md

Ask me if you have any questions for clarification, and continue to write the PRD.
